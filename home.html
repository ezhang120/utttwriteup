      The goal of this project was to <b class = "bold">examine an interface and three users to step into their shoes and 
      understand their experiences</b>. I then created <b class = "bold">two personas and a storyboard</b> based on my findings.

        This interface is a lamp that provides light and several customizable features. The base of the lamp offers 
        <b class = "bold">(on the top row of buttons starting from the left): power, light modes, (on the bottom row of buttons starting 
        from the left): dimmer light, a 1 hour timer, a 2 hour timer, brighter light</b>, (on the back of the base): 
        USB portals for charging another device. These buttons are flat on the base of the lamp and light up when 
        the lamp is on. The lamp is adjustable at two joints: one where the body connects to the base, and one where 
        the light connects to the body.

        User 1

      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">User 1 uses the lamp at night <b class = "bold">to do homework on paper</b> (around three times a week). User 1 would rate this lamp 
          at an 8. He <b class = "bold"> doesn’t use any buttons other than the power button and thinks that the lamp could have more feature
          than it currently does</b>. User 1 likes that there is <b class = "bold">no sound when any of the buttons are pressed and thinks that 
          the lamp responds quickly</b> when buttons are pressed (when compared to other lamps, which usually make a sound when 
          they’re turned on and may take more time to react). He likes the layout of the lamp because the <b class = "bold">two main buttons 
          (power and mode) are placed above the other buttons</b>. When using the lamp, User 1 feels <b class = "bold">annoyed and unexcited </b>

          <h5 class="card-title">Followup Answers</h5>
          <p class="card-text"> When User 1 first used the lamp, he played around with the settings until he was satisfied with the results. 
            He also had to adjust settings often because it was placed in a common study room and others would change the 
            settings. User 1 found it <b class = "bold">bothersome to have to constantly adjust the lamp settings because other people used 
            it as well</b>. Now, he only uses the power button because he brought the lamp home and his preferred settings from 
            the last time he used the lamp remain unchanged. Prior to using this lamp this semester at home, User 1 did not
            have a lamp in his room. </p>

        adjustment buttons have <b class = "bold">easily recognizable symbols</b>). User 2 likes the layout of the buttons because it looks nice and
        the <b class = "bold">main buttons are placed above the other functions</b>. Before using the lamp, User 2 has the impression that the lamp 
        is modern and fancy. He also thinks it would be quite expensive. While using the lamp, User 2 has the impression that 
        the lamp responds well to simple touch. Because he would use the lamp to do work, User 2 thinks he would feel <b class = "bold">reluctant

    User 3

  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">User 3 thinks she would use this lamp in the common study area to <b class = "bold">do homework when it is dark</b>. User 3 would 
      rate this lamp at a 8 or 9 because the design looks nice and the lamp can be adjusted in a variety of ways. 
      User 3 thinks that the <b class = "bold">timer function isn’t very obvious but likes the simple, straightforward symbols</b> like 
      the power, mode, and brightness adjustment. User 3 thinks the lamp controls respond to light touch well, but 
      is worried that the buttons might break or malfunction in the future if she presses them too roughly. User 3 
      likes the <b class = "bold">balanced layout of the buttons but thinks that the buttons should not light up when the lamp is on </b>
      because it makes it hard to see the symbols and the lights don’t give much information (other than the lights 
      behind the timer buttons that indicate activation of a timer). User 3 feels <b class = "bold">excited</b> when using the lamp 
      because she thinks it looks very technological, which she likes. </p>
      <h5 class="card-title">Followup Questions</h5>
      <p class="card-text"> <ul>
        <li>Why did you press the buttons several times?</li>

      </ul></p>
      <h5 class="card-title">Followup Answers</h5>
      <p class="card-text"> User 3 wanted to see what all the buttons did because she was unfamiliar with them and switched through the
        modes several times to make sure she didn’t miss any of the modes. User 3 would likely use the warm mode light 
        because it’s easier on the eyes at night. User 3 thinks she would potentially use the timer to time her 
        studying or before she goes to sleep in her bed, but she thinks it would be a little impractical.</p>

      Conclusion: 
    </h3>
    <p> Through this project, I learned that user observation and interviews are important sources to discover the good and bad qualities 
      of an interface. Users feedback is extremely important because as UI/UX designers, we are creating products for the users. <br>
        I also learned that personas and corresponding empathy maps or storyboards are great tools for considering the user experience for specific
        kinds of users and to determine who I am designing for.
